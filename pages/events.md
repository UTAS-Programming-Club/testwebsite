We run a number of events each year for the benefit of our members.\
Here are some examples from the last few years that we hope to continue into 2025:

### Weekly Meetups
Every week during semester we run a meetup at the Sandy Bay campus as well as online on Discord where members can chill out after a busy week, discuss goings-on and work together of various club and personal projects. Snacks included!
We hope to have Launceston meetups in the future, please let us know if you would like to attend or even help out with that!

In 2025, our meetups run from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM on Thursdays in [Centenary 140](https://maps.utas.edu.au/d/poi/1000554240) and remotely via [Discord Voice Chat](https://discord.com/channels/810048533603680307/816975438332035102).

### Game Jams
We are proud to send Club members to various game jam events across the past few years including the [UTas School of ICT Jam](https://itch.io/jam/utas-jam) in 2022, [Tas Game Makers' TasJam](https://itch.io/jam/tasjam-2024) in 2024 and [Apple Box Studio's Game Jam Tas](https://globalgamejam.org/jam-sites/2025/global-game-jam-tasmania)(part of the Global Game Jam) in early 2025.
Hopefully these will continue into 2025 and beyond!

Additionally, we are currently planning our own jam tentatively scheduled for the mid year break. We will announce more details as we get closer to that.

### Collaborative Events with MAPS
We have run combined games and movie nights with the Maths and Physics Society since 2023.\
The next one is planned for the 15th of April in Week 8, hopefully we well see you there. [Entry](https://campus.hellorubric.com/?eid=34039)(via Rubric) is free for members of either club.

### STEM Balls
The Programming Club has helped organise the annual STEM ball and many of our members have attended ever since the inaugural ball in 2023.
The STEM Ball is run by the UTAS clubs in the STEM fields (minus engineering), and is their social highlight of the year.

The next STEM ball will be on 20 September 2025. Tickets will be $80 for members of any of the associated clubs and $90 otherwise. We should have the Rubric ticket sale page up soon with some more details.

<!-- TODO: Link to Stem BBQ Rubric sign up page once up -->
### BBQs
We have held public barbeques on the Sandy Bay campus since 2023 with cheap food available and even discounts for members.
We cater to as many people as possible by offering both meat and vegan options as well as soft drinks.\
They are one of the events where the Club engages with the wider student community.

We currently do not have one scheduled for this year but will be helping out with the STEM Ball announcement BBQ on the 21st of May at the Sandy Bay campus, more details later on.

### Industry Nights
In 2023 we ran an educational event with former students taking about their experiences finding work in Tasmania and more broardly in Australia.
There was also the Industry Day session last year as part of the state government's Level Up Tas which serves as similar role but for video game creation specifically which some members attended last year.

We hope to run another night later in 2025 in collaboration with the School of ICT.

### Movie Nights
In 2024, the Programming Club hosted a movie night after our AGM where we watched The Terminator.\
We hope to repeat this again at the 2025 AGM, send us your movie suggestions via Discord!

### UTAS Clubs and Societies Days
The Programming Club has run stalls at the University's Clubs and Societies days since 2022 and the new Mini Clubs and Societies day since it began in 2024.
We use these events to talk to students about our events and show off the projects that members have worked on in years prior.\
We should be at the Mini C&S day during Semester 2 in 2025 so hopefully we will see you there!

### General Meetings
Our general meetings are held to discuss broader club matters such as significant club decisions and the election of officers.
All Club members are invited to attend and may vote in proceedings.
There are two types of general meeting: our annual general meeting which has run every year since 2021; and special general meetings, which will be run whenever there is important business to discuss including recently in both 2023 and 2024.

Our next general meeting should be in October 2025 and will hopefully be followed by a movie night!
